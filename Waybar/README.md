# Quick Information
Waybar is a program typically used alongside Window Tiling Managers, such as Hyprland. It can be customized using a `.jsonc` and `.css` file, allowing for literally any combination of styles you want.

My Waybar config is forked from [here](https://github.com/woioeow/hyprland-dotfiles/blob/main/hypr_style2/waybar/style.css), though customized to fit **my** needs. If my config doesn't suite you, feel free to look around, change things, or just use a different config!

Configuring Waybar has endless possibilities, so just have fun with it!

# Installation

First, make sure you have [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) installed (Install it if not)

Then, navigate to your Waybar config folder using:
```bash
cd ~/.config/waybar
```

And replace every file in there with the ones you see in this repository, create/modify any if needed. Feel free to use your preferred Text Editor, such as [Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/), [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), or [VSCode](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/code/).

Reload Waybar using the following commands (Or use a keybind if you have one set):
```bash
killall waybar
waybar
```

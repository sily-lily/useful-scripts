# Learning and Understanding Bash (.sh)
To be clear, Bash (.sh) is not the same as Batch (.bat), which is used for Windows. Bash is primarily used in Unix/Linux environments, but can also be used on Windows by installing external tools like [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Bash is a very simple and easy to understand scripting language used in Unix for automating simple tasks, similar to Batch (.bat) on Windows ([MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS) or the [Windows NT Kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT)).

## Lessons
You can learn Bash with me by following the guides I've written to help me and hopefully other people understand Bash syntax and how to use it effectively.
